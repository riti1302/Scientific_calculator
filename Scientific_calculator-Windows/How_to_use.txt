      Here are the instructions to use the Scientific calculator:
          You can perform 30 different operations in it!

       It calculates the decimal numbers upto 7 precision points.
     In order to perform any operation follow the following steps:
     [1] If it is a binary operation then:
        (1) Enter the first operand.
        (2) Enter the operator.
        (3) Enter the second operand.
        (4) Result will be displayed.
   
     [2] If it is a unary operation then:
        (1) Enter the operand.
        (2) Enter the operator.
        (3) Result will be displayed.
   
     [3] After the execution of first operation, the second operation
         takes the result  of first operation as its first operand.

     [4] If you want to perform a fresh operation with both inputs of
         operand  and operator taken from the user then enter "clr"
         (i.e., clear screen).

     [5] If you want to see the history of your calculations then enter
         "mem"(i.e, memory). This will display all your calculations that
         you performed so far.

     [6] If you want to close the calcultor then enter "exit".
